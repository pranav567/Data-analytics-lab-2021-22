Inference:

For the above experiment, the objective was to perform descriptive analysis and find out what information does the data provide. For this the dataset taken is about video game sales released across different platforms between 1980-2020. The dataset contains the sales in North America, Europe, Japan and others combined. It also shows the scores given by critics and users and the number of critics and years. The genre of the game is also given. The following points were concluded form the above analysis:

* the correlation matrix showed that the sales for each of the 3 regions have high correlation and global sales also has high correlation with other sales columns since it is the sum of those columns.
* the global sales and critic , user scores had a lot of outliers, so these outliers were removed from the data.
* the platform 'PS2' had the highest global sales.
* the data was were trimmed by adding the condition to get data only for the last decade, to see the latest platforms that performed well globally.
* the sales of video games decreased from 2011 - 2020
* The region 'JP' which had the lowest sales compared to the other regions, had the slowest decline compared to others.
* the genre 'Action' saw the highest sales while 'Strategy' saw the lowest sales among the different genres of games in the dataset.
* for comparison of platforms by scores, first I removed games which had lowest the number of critic and user counts.
* the games on platform DS received higher scores compared to PS3 by critics and same pattern was observed in the user scores.
* Critics voted Shooter games the lowest while the users voted Sports as lowest and Adventure as highest.
* Since the outliers that were removed had higher sales for the particular games, most of the games that were removed had the rating A(adult only), it can be concluded that most of the games which had higher sales were mostly Adult rated.
